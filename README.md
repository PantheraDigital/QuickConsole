# QuickConsole
 
One of my first real coding projects was an ASCII game played in the console and over time I find myself returning to this project idea as a way to refresh skills or learn a new language. A consistent tool I find I need is a class that out[uts text to the console more efficiently while supporting color and more characters. I have created these classes a few times now and have decided to save them and make them public.

Each branch has a class that can be used instead of the standard method for output in different languages. The class is called QuickConsole while the source files hold some examples of usage.
