# QuickConsole
 
The implementation of this class in C++

Two ways are included, one ANSI based and the other uses just Windows functions.
ANSI will work with Linux and newer Windows consoles (Windows 10) but may be more cumbersome to use. It also supports layers.
The non-ANSI version should work with all Windows consoles and is easier to use.
